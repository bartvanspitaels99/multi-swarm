# Basic Concepts

Multi-Swarm is built around several core concepts that work together to create powerful AI agent collaborations.

## Core Components

### 1. Agents

Agents are autonomous AI entities with specific roles and capabilities:

- Each agent has a defined purpose and set of responsibilities
- Agents use different LLM models based on their needs
- Agents can have their own tools and instructions
- Agents communicate with each other through structured channels

Example:
```python
class AnalystAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="Data Analyst",
            description="Expert in data analysis",
            model="claude-3.5-sonnet",
            temperature=0.5
        )
```

### 2. Tools

Tools are specific actions that agents can perform:

- Tools are Python classes that inherit from `BaseTool`
- Tools can interact with external services, APIs, or local resources
- Tools are automatically loaded from the agent's tools folder
- Tools can be shared between agents

Example:
```python
class DataVisualizationTool(BaseTool):
    """Tool for creating data visualizations."""
    data: List[Dict] = Field(..., description="Data to visualize")
    chart_type: str = Field(..., description="Type of chart to create")

    def run(self):
        # Tool implementation
        return "Visualization created"
```

### 3. Agencies

Agencies are collections of agents working together:

- Agencies define communication flows between agents
- Agencies can share common instructions and goals
- Agencies coordinate agent interactions
- Agencies handle message routing and responses

Example:
```python
agency = Agency(
    agents=[
        manager,  # Entry point
        [manager, developer],  # Manager can talk to developer
        [developer, tester],   # Developer can talk to tester
    ],
    shared_instructions="agency_manifesto.md"
)
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Communication Flows

- **Directional Communication**: Agents communicate in defined directions
- **Message Passing**: Agents can pass messages and delegate tasks
- **Structured Responses**: Communication follows defined formats
- **Async Support**: Communication is asynchronous by default

### 2. Model Selection

- **Task Matching**: Choose models based on task requirements
- **Cost Efficiency**: Balance capability with cost
- **Specialization**: Use models for their strengths
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine multiple models effectively

### 3. Instructions

- **Role Definition**: Clear description of agent responsibilities
- **Process Workflows**: Step-by-step task execution guides
- **Goals**: Specific objectives for each agent
- **Collaboration Guidelines**: How to work with other agents

### 4. Tools and Capabilities

- **Automatic Loading**: Tools are loaded from specified folders
- **Type Safety**: Tools use Pydantic for validation
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error management
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new capabilities

## Design Patterns

### 1. Hierarchical Organization

```python
# Manager delegates to specialists
agency = Agency([
    manager,
    [manager, specialist1],
    [manager, specialist2],
])
```

### 2. Peer Collaboration

```python
# Agents can work together as peers
agency = Agency([
    coordinator,
    [peer1, peer2],
    [peer2, peer1],
])
```

### 3. Pipeline Processing

```python
# Sequential processing chain
agency = Agency([
    intake,
    [intake, processor],
    [processor, reviewer],
    [reviewer, publisher],
])
```

## Best Practices

1. **Agent Design**
   - Give agents focused responsibilities
   - Use appropriate model for each role
   - Provide clear, detailed instructions
   - Implement necessary error handling

2. **Tool Implementation**
   - Create reusable, focused tools
   - Validate inputs with Pydantic
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Document tool functionality

3. **Agency Structure**
   - Define clear communication paths
   - Avoid circular dependencies
   - Balance workload between agents
   - Monitor performance and costs

4. **Error Handling**
   - Implement retries for API calls
   - Handle rate limits appropriately
   - Log errors for debugging
   - Graceful degradation

## Common Patterns

### 1. Manager-Worker Pattern

```python
class ManagerAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Coordinates work and delegates tasks."""
    pass

class WorkerAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Executes specific tasks."""
    pass

agency = Agency([
    manager,
    [manager, worker1],
    [manager, worker2],
])
```

### 2. Pipeline Pattern

```python
class ProcessingPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agency = Agency([
            self.intake,
            [self.intake, self.processor],
            [self.processor, self.validator],
            [self.validator, self.publisher],
        ])
```

### 3. Expert System Pattern

```python
class ExpertSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agency = Agency([
            self.coordinator,
            [self.coordinator, self.expert1],
            [self.coordinator, self.expert2],
            [self.coordinator, self.expert3],
        ])
```
